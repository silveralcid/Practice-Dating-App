## Project Information

This Dating App practice project was another self-initiated effort as part of my preparation for upcoming coursework at Western Governors University. The project features Angular, Entity Framework Core, ASP.NET Core, and C#, allowing me to explore the integration of a full-stack application using modern web technologies. It was also my first time working with TypeScript, and I found it to be a significant improvement over vanilla JavaScript, offering better type safety and developer experience.

While the project is functional, it remains incomplete by design. The goal was to develop a learning-focused project that would give me hands-on experience with Angular, ASP.NET Core, C#, and TypeScript. Although I do not plan to extend this project further, it provided a rewarding opportunity to solidify my understanding of the above technologies, preparing me for more advanced work in my academic and professional development.

### Key Learnings and Features:
- Built a web application from start to deployment using .NET 8, Entity Framework Core, C#, and Angular (v18).
- Gained practical experience in structuring an Angular application using best practices and architectural patterns.
- Integrated third-party components into the Angular frontend to extend functionality and improve user experience.
- Efficiently used Visual Studio Code to enhance workflow and streamline the development process.
- Implemented core ASP.NET features using C#, including AutoMapper for efficient object-object mapping.
- Developed a drag-and-drop photo upload feature, integrating it into a cloud storage platform for seamless media management.
- Created a private messaging system that allows secure communication between users.
- Implemented data filtering, sorting, and paging for a user-friendly and performant interface.
- Integrated real-time notifications and presence tracking using SignalR for live updates.
- Built an authentication system using JWT Authentication tokens for secure user login and session management.
- Gained experience handling errors in both the API and the Single Page Application (SPA) layers for robust and maintainable code.
- Persisted data using Entity Framework Core and C# for seamless database interactions.
- Displayed Angular notifications to enhance user engagement and feedback.
